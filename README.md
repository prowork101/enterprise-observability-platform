# Enterprise Observability & Monitoring Platform

## Overview

This project implements a centralized monitoring and alerting platform on AWS using Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, and SNS. The solution provides real time visibility into infrastructure health, performance metrics, and operational status while enabling automated alerting and incident response.

Provisioned SNS topics and email subscriptions for alert notifications.

### Step 3: EC2 Monitoring Server Deployment

Deployed an EC2 instance to host monitoring services.

### Step 4: Security Group Configuration

Configured network access for SSH, Grafana, Prometheus, and Node Exporter.

### Step 5: Prometheus Installation

Installed and configured Prometheus for metrics collection.

### Step 6: Grafana Installation

Installed Grafana and configured dashboard access.

### Step 7: Node Exporter Deployment

Installed Node Exporter to collect system metrics.

### Step 8: Dashboard Creation

Built dashboards for CPU, memory, disk, and uptime monitoring.

### Step 9: CloudWatch Alarm Configuration

Configured CloudWatch alarms for infrastructure monitoring.

### Step 10: SNS Alert Validation

Validated email notifications and alert delivery workflows.

## Business Impact
